# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose 
The purpose of this assignment was to visualize campaign outcomes based on launch date and to visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount in order to provide real world data analysis to customer Lousie regarding her play *Fever*'s potential future campaigns. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
An analysis was performed looking at outcomes based on launch date. Through this analysis it was determined that the most successful campaigns were started in May with the least number of successful campaigns starting in December.  Additionally, the least amount of failed campaigns occured in the month of November and the most failed campaigns started in the months of May and October, respectively. Infact, very few campaings were canceled in general. Finally, it is important to note that zero campaigns were canceled in the month of October. See below *Figure 1*.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
An analysis was performed looking at outcomes based on funding goals. Through this analysis it was determined that the percentage of successful campaigns is higher than the percentage of failed campaigns, between less than $1,000 and $15,000; and then again between $35,000 and $45,000. It is important to note that all campaings with a goal over $45,000  and less than $49,999 failed and that less than 20% of campaigns with a goal of $50,000 or more were successful. Additioanlly, the highest percentage of successful campaigns had goals of less than $1,000.  See below *Figure 2*.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
During this analysis several challenges were encountered. The first was ensuring that all pre-work was correctly completed, particularly the text to columns for the Parent and Subcategory categories of theater/play. Without correctly separating these two text, additional data was pulled into my pivot tables and graphs for other parent/subcategories of theater/spaces and theater/musical. The second challenge encountered was using the multiple criteria and range formula of COUNTIFS, with an "s", instead of the singular criteria and range COUNTIF. Additional challeneges could have been manually retyping all of the COUNTIF formulas for each of the 12 rows and 8 columns in the Outcomes Based on Goals chart, without making an error. Therefore it was extremely useful to be able to search, find, and replace the names of "successful", "failed" and "canceled" in all of the COUNTIFS formulas.   

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
