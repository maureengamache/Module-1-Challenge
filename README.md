# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose 
The purpose of this assignment was to visualize campaign outcomes based on launch date and to visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount in order to provide real world data analysis to customer Lousie regarding her play *Fever*'s potential future campaigns. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
An analysis was performed looking at outcomes based on launch date. Through this analysis it was determined that the most successful campaigns were started in May with the least number of successful campaigns starting in December.  Additionally, the least amount of failed campaigns occured in the month of November and the most failed campaigns started in the months of May and October, respectively. Infact, very few campaings were canceled in general. Finally, it is important to note that zero campaigns were canceled in the month of October. See below *Figure 1*.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Analysis was performed looking at outcomes based on funding goals. Through this analysis it was determined that the percentage of successful campaigns is higher than the percentage of failed campaigns, between less than $1,000 and $15,000 and then again between $35,000 and $45,000. It is important to note that all campaings with a goal over $45,000  and less than $49,999 failed and that less than 20% of campaigns with a goal of $50,000 or more were successful. Additioanlly, the highest percentage of successful campaigns were achieved with goals of less than $1,000.  See *Figure 2*.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
